The Hair, Makeup, Skincare, and Fragrance Thread will be posted every Tuesday morning (~9AM PST)!

This thread is for simple hair and makeup questions that you may have, especially those that don't warrant their own thread. We all want a diversified opinion, so feel free to answer any questions (of which you know the answer).

Example questions: 

* What's a good conditioner for straight, thick hair?
* Where can I find a perfume with subtle pine notes?
* Do you use a foundation with sunscreen? Is it worth it?
