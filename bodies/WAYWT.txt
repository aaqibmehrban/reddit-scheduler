WAYWT is an initialism for "What Are You Wearing Today". It doesn't necessarily need to be what you were wearing TODAY.

* Post as often as you like, but edit your first post with pictures

* Include what the attire is for (work, school, home)

* Pictures are incredibly encouraged as it's quite tough to imagine what someone else is wearing without them.

* Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual. Take a lesson from Dale Carnegie's [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) if needed. It takes balls to post pictures of yourself on the Internet, the least you can do is accord the same courtesy as you would to someone in real life.

* **Please do not downvote for not agreeing with someone's opinion.**

* [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) makes it very easy to view pictures in a thread.
