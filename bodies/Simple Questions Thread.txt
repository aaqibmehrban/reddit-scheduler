**Simple Questions Thread will be posted every Thursday mornings (pacific time)!**

---

This thread is for simple style questions that you may have, especially those that don't warrant their own thread.
We all want a diversified opinion, so feel free to answer any questions (of which you know the answer).

Example questions: What are your favorite black boots <$250? What should I wear on a date? Are there any good white t-shirts?
